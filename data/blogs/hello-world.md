# Welcome to my blog

This is my first blog post! I'm excited to finally set up a space where I can share my thoughts, experiences, and technical insights.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about:
- **Tech stuff** — deep dives into problems I've solved, tools I'm exploring, and things I've learned
- **osu! and gaming** — my journey as part of the osu!team and the beatmapping/modding community
- **Random musings** — occasionally just vibes and life updates

## Why a blog?

Sometimes a Discord message or tweet just isn't enough. I wanted a place where I could elaborate on ideas without character limits, and maybe help someone else who stumbles upon similar problems.

Stay tuned for more posts!
